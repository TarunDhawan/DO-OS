# DO-OS

DO-OS is an Operating System for Doers.

It is a CLI-first, AI-powered working system designed primarily for product managers and knowledge workers who want to execute faster, automate repeatable work, and learn applied AI by building and using the system itself.

The name DO-OS pays respect to the original DOS, while redefining what an operating system means in a world where intelligence, not windows, drives work.

This is not a kernel.
This is an execution layer for modern product work.

---

## The problem DO-OS is solving

Product managers and knowledge workers spend a disproportionate amount of time on repetitive, predictable tasks before and after shipping a product feature:

• Creating product artifacts again and again
• Defining analytics and success metrics from scratch
• Writing launch notes, demos, decks, and documentation
• Collecting early feedback and synthesizing insights
• Running post-launch analysis and summaries

These tasks are important, but they should not consume most of a professional’s cognitive energy.

DO-OS exists for one simple belief:

No one should waste time repeating work that can be systematized.

---

## What DO-OS is

DO-OS is:

• A personal, local-first operating layer for work
• A CLI that understands product intent, not just commands
• An AI-powered workflow engine for repeatable execution
• A learning system for thinking in systems and automation

It helps you turn product work into reusable, composable operations.

---

## What DO-OS is not

DO-OS is not:

• A traditional operating system or Linux distro
• A chat interface pretending to be productivity
• A rigid framework that forces one way of working
• A replacement for existing tools

It runs on top of your existing OS and integrates with real files, tools, APIs, and workflows.

---

## Primary users

DO-OS is designed first for:

• Product managers
• Knowledge workers doing complex, repeatable work

Engineers, consultants, and founders are natural secondary users, but the core mental model is product execution.

---

## Core philosophy

DO-OS is intentionally opinionated in one area:

Repeatable work should be effortless.

Everything else remains flexible.

Its guiding principles are:

• CLI first: speed, composability, and precision
• Intent over instructions: describe outcomes, not steps
• AI as a worker: plan, execute, and improve
• Automation compounds: anything done twice is a candidate
• Systems thinking: turn workflows into assets

---

## The v0.1 focus

If DO-OS only does one thing extremely well, it will be this:

Make day-of-launch and post-launch product activities effortless and automated.

This includes:

• Generating product artifacts from a single source of truth
• Defining analytics and success metrics
• Creating demo scripts, decks, or videos
• Collecting and summarizing early feedback
• Running post-launch analysis and reporting

---

## Example (conceptual)

```
do launch prepare feature-x
do launch checklist
do analytics define feature-x
do demo create from spec.md
do feedback collect --week 1
do launch review feature-x
```

Each command is backed by AI agents, templates, and workflows that improve over time.

---

## High-level architecture (early)

The system is evolving, but the current mental model includes:

• DO Shell: a CLI interface for intent-driven commands
• Workflow engine: reusable, composable task definitions
• AI agents: planning, writing, analyzing, synthesizing
• Memory layer: context, history, and learned preferences
• Integrations: files, docs, analytics tools, APIs

---

## Learning by building

DO-OS is also a learning project.

By using and extending it, users learn:

• How to think in systems instead of tasks
• How to design repeatable workflows
• How AI agents actually work in practice
• How to turn personal work habits into code

Teaching users to think in systems is a first-class goal.

---

## Current status

This project is in active early design and experimentation.

Current goals:

• Define the core command language
• Build a minimal but real CLI
• Implement a small number of high-leverage workflows
• Learn deeply by building in public

Expect rough edges. Expect iteration.

---

## Roadmap (early)

• v0.1: CLI + launch/post-launch workflows
• v0.2: Workflow customization and reuse
• v0.3: Memory and personalization
• v1.0: A daily operating system for product work

---

## Open source and learning-first

DO-OS is currently:

• Fully open source
• A learning-first project
• Not driven by monetization

The goal is clarity, usefulness, and real execution leverage.

---

## Why this matters

Work is not getting simpler.
AI is not helpful unless it is operational.
Product work is repeatable, whether we admit it or not.

DO-OS exists to turn that reality into an advantage.
